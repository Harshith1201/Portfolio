			title: "Malware Threat Intelligence Scrapper",
			description:
				"I built this real-time threat intelligence system out of my passion for cybersecurity. It automatically collects and analyzes malware, vulnerability, and phishing data from various online sources. I'm particularly proud of implementing the NLP components that help analyze threats and validate community reports. The web dashboard makes it easy for users to access actionable insights through a clean API.",

			title: "IOT-based Blood Bank Management System",
			description:
				"Working with a small team of three, I helped create this innovative blood bank management solution that I'm really excited about. We developed two React Native apps and a website that connect donors with recipients, while using IoT sensors to monitor blood storage conditions. I implemented the QR code-based safety verification system and worked on the real-time tracking features. This project taught me a lot about healthcare tech and the importance of reliable systems when lives are at stake.",

			title: "Implementation of Schnorr Signature",
			description:
				"During my cryptography coursework, I became fascinated with Schnorr signatures and their applications in blockchain technology. I created this interactive web-based simulation to help others understand how these digital signatures work. The project features a visual demonstration of signature aggregation and verification, making complex cryptographic concepts more accessible. I built this using Flask for the backend and simple HTML/CSS for the frontend interface.",
